<summary>1- What is JavaScript?</summary>

  **Answer**: JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on web pages. JavaScript is versatile and can be used on both the client-side and server-side (Node.js).

JavaScript allows developers to create rich web applications by manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), handling events, and communicating with servers through AJAX requests. It is also a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

<summary>2. What are the different data types in JavaScript?</summary>

  **Answer**: 
  1. Primitive Data Types:
     - String: Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello, World!".
     - Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers, e.g., 42 or 3.14.
     - Boolean: Represents logical entities with two values: true or false.
     - Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value has the type undefined.
     - Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value, often used to indicate "no value".
     - Symbol (ES6): A unique and immutable primitive value used as the key of an object property.
     - BigInt (ES2020): Represents integers with arbitrary precision, allowing for manipulation of large integers beyond the safe integer limit for numbers.

  2. Non-Primitive Data Types:
     - Object: A collection of key-value pairs, often used to store more complex data and entities.
